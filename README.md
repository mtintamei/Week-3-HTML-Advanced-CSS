# Hands-on Exercise: Creating a Responsive Webpage with a Flexible Layout

## Overview

In this project, I have designed and developed a responsive webpage for TeleMed Care, focusing on creating a flexible layout that adapts to various screen sizes. The webpage includes a header, navigation bar, main content area, sidebar, and footer, all styled to be responsive and user-friendly.

## Key Features

- **Header**: Contains a logo and title for TeleMed Care, styled with a background color and aligned elements.
- **Navigation Bar**: Features a horizontal menu with links to key sections. On smaller screens, the navigation transforms into a hamburger menu that can be toggled.
- **Main Content Area**: Utilizes Flexbox for layout. The main section provides information about TeleMed Care, including benefits of the service, and the sidebar contains a search bar and quick links.
- **Sidebar**: Designed to complement the main content with additional navigation options and a search bar. The layout adjusts on smaller screens.
- **Footer**: Includes copyright information, social media links, and contact details, all centered and styled for clarity.

## Responsive Design

- **Flexbox Layout**: Applied Flexbox to create a flexible layout for the main content and sidebar, ensuring that they adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Implemented to handle responsiveness. The layout switches to a column format for smaller screens, and the navigation menu becomes a toggleable hamburger menu.

## Code Highlights

- **HTML Structure**: Organized with semantic elements for clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS Styles**: Custom styles applied for layout, colors, and responsive behavior, including the use of Flexbox and media queries.
- **Responsive Adjustments**: Ensured the site is functional and visually appealing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Files

- `index.html`: Main HTML file with the webpage structure.
- `styles.css`: CSS file with styles for layout, design, and responsiveness.

Feel free to explore the code and see how the responsive design and flexible layout were implemented!
